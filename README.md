# CHES-ABM

Welcome to the FNNR-ABM project! I will edit this read-me with information about the files soon.
For now, to view the simulation in-progress, please run server.py.

<b><u>Dependencies</u></b>
Python 3.0+ - any version of Python 3.X.X will work, since Mesa requires Python 3 or higher. The code was built on Python 3.6.1.
Mesa - An ABM framework for Python. Install using pip/Anaconda (recommended) or download the .tar.gz file from the website.
