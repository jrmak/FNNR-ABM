Hours/Days of Work Reported (Assuming 4-hour days)
Paid days of work completed - 46 (as of end of 7/31)
Days reported and submitted on SDSURF EMP timesheet - 43 + 5 extra paid days will be put in (as discussed)

To-do List
- Complete export file for step-by-step data to write to *IN PROGRESS
- Add graphs to simulation window to be updated each step *IN PROGRESS
- Fix anomalous numbers appearing such as 16 migrants/household *IN PROGRESS
- Update to newest pseudocode version (limit migration to 1 person per household if 2 or more members, etc.) *IN PROGRESS

Bug Fixes Needed
- tornado WARNING:404 favicon.ico missing (safe to ignore)
- When simulation is reset in-browser, marriage text element is not reset (side effect of using a list-append approach)
