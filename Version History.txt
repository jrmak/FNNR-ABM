Version History

Pseudocode Version 5 (0621)
v1.42 - 6/28/2017 - Debugging on individual and immigration functions NOTE: compare v1.37 to 1.42 directly,
some 1.42 changes got saved to 1.41
v1.41 - 6/27/2017 - Further debugging, added immigration functions

Pseudocode Version 4 (0619)
v1.37 - 6/26/2017 - Changes to class object attribute assignments to help organize/debug functions
v1.36 - 6/23/2017 - Debugging on marriage match function, creation of birth/death functions
v1.35 - 6/22/2017 - Debugging on marriage match function
v1.34 - 6/21/2017 - Edited main loop formula, created individual ids, worked on single male listing
v1.33 - 6/20/2017 - Edited main loop formula (same as yesterday), initialized individual attributes

Pseudocode Version 3 (0612)
v1.32 - 6/19/2017 - Edited main loop formula (max distance of land parcel per household calculation for each step)
v1.31 - 6/16/2017 - Edited main loop formula (testing real data value imports)

Pseudocode Version 2 (0609)
v1.26 - 6/15/2017 - Completed last part of pseudocode, simulation running again
v1.25 - 6/14/2017 - Distance calculation/household linking to each land parcel (last part of pseudocode)
v1.24 - 6/13/2017 - Table put on hold, working on linking each household to all land parcels vs. first one only (last part of pseudocode)
v1.23 - 6/9 and 6/12/2017 - Collaborated with Shuang and drastically changed agent step formula (main loop of pseudocode). Currently working on adding a table; running into issues with pandas.
v1.22 - 6/8/2017 - Changed agent step formula (self.num_mig). Added migration chart to web simulation.
v1.21 - 6/7/2017 - Clarified further data values (self.num_mig and self.num_laborers in pseudocode agent step formula). Comments added. Code updated to PEP8 style guidelines.
v1.2 - 6/5 - 6/6/2017 - Simulation running with some data values clarified (Land Parcel longitude and latitude for GTGP and non-GTGP parcels). Restructured agents to new pseudo-code instructions (now features Land Parcel and Individual agents).

Pseudocode Version 1 (Not yet uploaded)
v1.1 - 6/2/2017 - Simulation running with Excel data (some dummy values) imported into simulation.
v1.0 - 6/1/2017 - ABM dummy simulation and server running.

v0.5 - 5/30/2017 - Code setup; data imported from Excel to Python variables (Household first individual age, position)
5/29/17 - day off (Memorial Day)
5/24 - 5/26/17 - Data structure, classes, and variables formed
5/23/17 - Initial meeting

Hours/Days of Work Reported
Days of work completed - 25
Days submitted on SDSURF EMP timesheet so far - 10 (6/19 - 6/30)
Maximum paid days of work to report - 45 (2 months, 5 days/week, 4 hours/day from 10am - 2pm)

To-do List
- Finish individual (household demography) processes *IN PROGRESS
- Update all self values with imported data values *IN PROGRESS
- Start modeling immigration behaviors from newest version of pseudocode
- Add a table with listed data values, updated each step
- Add simlulation map/window axis labels (coordinates) using matplotlib/JavaScript
- Add simulation map/window legend using matplotlib/JavaScript
- Implement BatchRunner (Mesa) for automated trials/testing
- Identify furthest land parcel from household, recalculating each step (does not currently affect simulation/numbers)

Bug Fixes Needed
- tornado WARNING:404 favicon.ico missing (safe to ignore)
