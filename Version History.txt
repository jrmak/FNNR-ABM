Other Activity History

Hours/Days of Work Reported (Assuming 4-hour days)
Days of work completed - 38 (as of end of 7/19)
Days reported and submitted on SDSURF EMP timesheet so far - 20

To-do List
- Complete export file for step-by-step data to write to *IN PROGRESS
- Add a graphs to simulation window to be updated each step *IN PROGRESS

Bug Fixes Needed
- tornado WARNING:404 favicon.ico missing (safe to ignore)
- When simulation is reset in-browser, marriage text element is not reset (side effect of using a list-append approach)
- Will need to identify furthest land parcel from household, recalculating each step (does not currently affect simulation/numbers)
